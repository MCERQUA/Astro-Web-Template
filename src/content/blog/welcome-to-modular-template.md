# Welcome to Your Modular Website Template

This template provides a comprehensive foundation for building modern websites with a modular component system. Let's explore how to get the most out of this powerful setup.

## What Makes This Template Special?

This isn't just another website template – it's a complete system designed to help you build faster, more consistently, and with less duplication.

### Component Registry System

The heart of this template is the **Component Registry** (`src/components/componentRegistry.ts`). This file serves as a central index of all available components, helping you:

- **Avoid duplicates** by checking existing components first
- **Maintain consistency** across your entire website
- **Track component usage** and dependencies
- **Collaborate effectively** with team members

### Tech Stack Highlights

- **Astro 5.11.0** - Lightning-fast static site generation
- **React 18.2.0** - Interactive components where needed
- **Tailwind CSS 3.4.1** - Utility-first styling
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better developer experience
- **Framer Motion** - Smooth animations and transitions

## Getting Started

### 1. Check the Component Registry

Before creating any new component, **always** check the registry first:

```typescript
// src/components/componentRegistry.ts
export const componentRegistry = {
  ui: {
    Button: {
      path: '@components/ui/Button',
      description: 'Primary button component with variants',
      props: ['children', 'variant?', 'size?', 'href?']
    }
    // ... more components
  }
};
```

### 2. Use Existing Components

Mix and match existing components to build your pages:

```astro
---
import Hero from '@components/sections/Hero.astro';
import BlogPreview from '@components/sections/BlogPreview.astro';
import ContactForm from '@components/sections/ContactForm.astro';
---

<Hero 
  title="Your Amazing Title"
  subtitle="Compelling subtitle here"
  ctaText="Get Started"
/>

<BlogPreview limit={3} showMore={true} />

<ContactForm title="Ready to Connect?" />
```

### 3. Create New Components (When Needed)

If you need a new component:

1. **Search the registry** thoroughly
2. **Consider extending** an existing component
3. **Create the component** with proper TypeScript interfaces
4. **Add to the registry** with complete documentation
5. **Keep files under 1000 lines**

## Best Practices

### File Organization

```
src/components/
├── componentRegistry.ts    # Central index
├── ui/                    # Reusable UI elements
│   ├── Button.astro
│   ├── Card.astro
│   └── Navbar.astro
├── sections/              # Page sections
│   ├── Hero.astro
│   ├── BlogPreview.astro
│   └── ContactForm.astro
└── lib/                   # Utilities
    └── utils.ts
```

### Component Documentation

Every component should be documented in the registry:

```typescript
NewComponent: {
  path: '@components/ui/NewComponent',
  description: 'Clear description of what it does',
  props: ['required-prop', 'optional-prop?'],
  variants: ['default', 'alternative'],
  status: 'ready' | 'in-progress' | 'deprecated'
}
```

### File Size Management

Keep files manageable:

- **Maximum 1000 lines per file**
- Split large components into smaller ones
- Extract utilities to `lib/` folder
- Use separate `.types.ts` files for complex types

## Building Your First Page

Here's how to create a new page using the modular system:

1. **Plan your layout** - What sections do you need?
2. **Check the registry** - What components already exist?
3. **Compose your page** - Use existing components
4. **Add new components** - Only if absolutely necessary
5. **Update the registry** - Document any new components

## Blog System

The template includes a fully-featured blog system:

- **Content collections** for type-safe content
- **Markdown support** with frontmatter
- **Automatic RSS feed** generation
- **SEO optimization** built-in
- **Tag and category** organization

Create blog posts by adding Markdown files to `src/content/blog/`:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Post Title"
description: "Brief description"
pubDate: 2025-01-15
tags: ["web-dev", "astro"]
---

# Your content here...
```

## Performance & SEO

This template is built for performance:

- **Static generation** for fast loading
- **Optimized images** with lazy loading
- **SEO meta tags** automatically generated
- **Schema markup** for rich snippets
- **Accessibility** features built-in

## Next Steps

1. **Explore the components** in `src/components/`
2. **Customize the design** in `tailwind.config.mjs`
3. **Add your content** to replace placeholder text
4. **Create new components** following the registry system
5. **Deploy your site** to your favorite hosting platform
